','Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the egg noodles, reduce the heat to a low boil, and cook the pasta al dente according to the package directions. Before draining the pasta, reserve Â¼ cup of pasta water. Drain the pasta well, but do not rinse. Place the pot back on the stove over medium heat and melt the butter and garlic powder.

','Preheat the oven to 425Â°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl add all ingredients, reserving 2 tablespoons of olive oil. In a large mixing bowl, combine flaked salmon, egg, garlic, panko bread crumbs, chives, red bell pepper, mayonnaise, parsley, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, lemon zest, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and black pepper. Gently combine the ingredients. Using a slightly heaping Â¼ cup measuring cup, scoop the mixture and form it into 9 patties. Press them together gently but firmly so they hold their shape and don\'t fall apart during baking. Place the salmon croquettes on the prepared baking sheet, and bake them in the preheated oven for 13-15 minutes or until they\'re lightly browned and cooked through. ',10),(308,'Cilantro Lime Dressing','This quick and easy cilantro lime dressing recipe adds fresh and zesty flavors to any meal.','In a blender or small food processor, add cilantro, garlic, lime juice, honey, cumin, apple cider vinegar, and light olive oil or canola oil.

','Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. On a shallow plate, combine flour, kosher salt, and pepper. Coat each cube steak with the seasoned flour mixture, shaking off any excess. In a 4qt dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Brown the cube steaks for 2 minutes on each side (adding additional olive oil if needed) or until lightly browned. Remove from the dutch oven and set aside. Melt the butter in the dutch oven and cook the onions over medium heat until they are tender. Add the wine and simmer over medium heat until it reduces by half. Add the browned steaks. Add remaining ingredients except for cornstarch. Cover and place in the oven. Cook for 2 Â½-3 hours or until fork-tender. Halfway through cooking, add 1 more cup of broth so the meat is covered with liquid.
